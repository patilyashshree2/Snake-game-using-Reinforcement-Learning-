This project contains the following files:

1. snake_env.py : run this and you can play the game Snake by yourself, (the file consists of all the required states and environmental parameters required for generic snake game).

2. agent_1.py : run this and a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent will learn to play snake game

3. plot_script.py : plotting the results of the agent.

4. requirements.txt : you will need some Python packages, like turtle, TensorFlow and Keras before you can run the scripts, install these first.

5. 530_Project_Report: Project Report.

6. Screen_Recording.. : Short video of the Game.

7. 530-Principles of AI...pdf : Presentation Slides pdf
